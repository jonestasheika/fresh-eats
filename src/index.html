     <p class="thick">Important Of Good Nutrition.</p>


            <p>Your food choices each day affect your health — how you feel today, tomorrow, and in the future.
              Good nutrition is an important part of leading a healthy lifestyle. Combined with physical activity, your diet can help you to reach and maintain a healthy weight, reduce your risk of chronic diseases (like heart disease and cancer), and promote your overall health. Unhealthy eating habits have contributed to the obesity epidemic in the United States: about one-third of U.S. adults (33.8%) are obese and approximately 17% (or 12.5 million) of children and adolescents aged 2—19 years are obese.1 Even for people at a healthy weight, a poor diet is associated with major health risks that can cause illness and even death. These include heart disease, hypertension (high blood pressure), type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and certain types of cancer. By making smart food choices, you can help protect yourself from these health problems.Unhealthy eating habits have contributed to the obesity epidemic in the United States: about one-third of U.S. adults (33.8%) are obese and approximately 17% (or 12.5 million) of children and adolescents aged 2—19 years are obese.1 Even for people at a healthy weight, a poor diet is associated with major health risks that can cause illness and even death.

                            <p>It can be hard to figure out what to eat when you need to lose weight, and a diet that only includes a few types of foods may be tempting because it is simple. A menu with only salad and protein can help you lose weight, but you would need to plan it carefully to reduce your risk of health problems from dietary imbalances. The best diet for weight loss also meets your nutrient requirements, and a nutritionist can work with you to develop the best plan for your individual needs.</p>
